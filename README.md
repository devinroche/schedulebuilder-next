# Schedule Builder (NextJS Build)
> Reacreation of [angular schedule builder](http://github.com/devinroche/schedulebuilder) using nextjs. this allows gonzaga students to generate all possible schedules given a list of upcoming classes. 

There are over 10,000,000 possible schedules for students to pick from. This is a mess when it comes to registration. This causes a lot of stress for students!
